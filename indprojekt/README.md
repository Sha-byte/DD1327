Projekt

This project is a linear algebra module created without 
using any of pythons built in modules like numpy except 
for input matrices and for my test function located in the file Test.py. 
Every function for this project located in the file Ind_projekt.py 
are matrix operations or calculations.  



### Roadmap

* The API of this library is frozen.
* Version numbers adhere to semantic versioning.

The only accepted reason to modify the API of this package
is to handle issues that can't be resolved in any other
reasonable way.
